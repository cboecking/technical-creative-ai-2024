# Role of IT

Specifically in applications like ERP/MRP

History: ticket for IT to do something
Future: ticket because "I" did something...

---
# Data
example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBseu9f3P5U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBseu9f3P5U "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbseu9f3p5u")

# Summary
- Keep information as text
- Give users access to data (sql, rest, jquery, ui)
- Promote sharing and collaboration
- Always be managing up and out
- You will find yourself and your technical creatives as the 'last ones standing'

# Find Kind Teachers

### AI is both wide and deep
### List of teachers

# Support Collaboration
- github repos
	- discussions
	- issues
- Slack, mattermost

# Types of Information
- Information
	- Why we exist
	- Strategies to add more value and generate more profit
	- Work Instructions
- Data
	- Databases

## My Beliefs

There is more pressure than ever

> Bigger demands wants better people

"Technical Creatives" will be the last ones standing

> Mind for data, play, and share

Change in systems guard

> What previously enabled now limits

Note:
Purpose: discuss AI's impact on business in 2024 at a high level.

Organizations are facing more threats and more opportunities simultaneously. 

www.Perplexity.ai vs www.Google.com is a fascinating story.

Situation translates to a greater dependency human performance.

If you think that you are going to hire a consultant to help you transform, going to be slow and expensive.

Here is the reality, being an employee will be like drinking from a fire hydrant.

Some are going to get blown away. They will struggle to ad value.

Some are going to shine. These are the clerks and technicians who completed their 100 days and play with codewars.

Opportunity exists when creative technicals + LLM (ollama) + Your data (postgresql) + your companies institutional knowledge (text) will transform how you do business

Action:
- include sections for event loggers => klaviyo
- Describe how to create creative technicals 
	- Cultivate kind teachers (ex no boilerplate)
- Future role of developers - co-seating
- Genius of PostgREST - security all the way down to the lowest level
- Include rabbit metrics video in this presentation
- Include Colab in this presentation

Extra:
More people are gaining more power everyday…
- Important: This is not just about technology
	- big moves are happening
- Example: https://www.perplexity.ai/
	- the AI did not create the application - the people did
	- Not just any people - Creative technicals
	- This people-focused comment is the bridge to the important topic: people are making the big moves

Companies will be called upon to do more or die (feature/capability improvements demanding - chatGPT API as example)
Managers will be called upon to manage/support this chaos
Employees …
  -- like drinking from a fire hydrant, some will take it all in, some will be blown away, some you will wonder

Some will become paralyzed, others will strive… Specifically, the Technical Creatives will thrive
 
 free your knowledge, instructions and data

Technical Creative:
- Has a vocational skill (ap clerk, line operator, etc…)
- Not scared (at least not outwardly)
- Has a mind for data
- Has a mind for workflow
- NOT: a highly paid programmer with a CS degree

Focus on progress over patents
Focus on collaboration

How do we manage these people and these powers?
Who can best take advantage of this power?
What organization is needed to maximize?

keep for reference - probably not use:
Salesforce created a market where you pay millions for your own data
Spent millions on engineering protected solutions
Now making it hard 
Choice between supabase and Salesforce - I choose supabase
Not apples to apples comparison - it is different
I want people who can go into the data - have the skills and knowledge to move through the data

## Power of Text
No Boilerplate image an qr code
Note:
Purpose is to persuade audience to consider github.com for text and productivity
You cannot talk about people until the tools are available.

Action:
- inner source - everyone gets access to github.com source
- slack (mattermost - sharing)
- 

---
## Text Example

Text to image - a simple text change results in big impact. Everyone and everything understands words. Translates to images, videos, curriculum in all languages in all formats.

Note:
Purpose is to demonstrate why text is so important.

Action:
- include text to video example as well - prompt engineering best gpt video has good example
- Turn this presentation into a gpt
- Consider referencing deepnote as a sql ready jupyter notebook

---
## Data Example

Point: the story matters most! What tells the story?
- words
- data

# First Principles - AI Focused

CEO: Protect your revenue and protect your people
- There is a real need for speed
COO: Plain Text is unreasonably effective (efficacy - scaling)
- Make sure everyone has access (instructions, data, value)
CTO: Store your data in text and open databases
- Give everyone the ability to innovate
People: Support sharing and learning
- Always be managing up, out or both (on any given day)

Notes:
Slides needs proper introduction - framing

CEO:
No one better than tesla (progress of patents)

COO:
Tech stepping back to create this huge step forward…

Right task at the right paygrade

# Models
- Base - Next token prediction
- Instruct - answer question and/or task
- Chat - Come what may...
---
# Terms
- RAG
- Embedding
- Vector store (db)
- AI Assistant

# Analogy of Development
- walk, eat, speak, cooperate
- Depth of complex thought
	- Think
	- Framed re-think
	- Synthesis or response
- Arrive at interview
- Learn recipes
- Apply right recipe at right time with convenience
# Human Augmentation
- How develop recipes (colab or function)
- How to apply recipes in context
- How orchestrate workflow
---
# Re-invent Implementation
- How I make the world a better place

# Other thoughts
- MRP is hard - salesforce is ridiculous
